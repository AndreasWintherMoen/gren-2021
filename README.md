## An easy to use digital platform for making the optimal shipping decision for your business needs

Made in React, this website lets cargo owners search for different shipment options and sort and filter based on CO2 emissions, price and time. This solution will make your business more efficient and help contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

To convey information regarding the CO2 emissions, expected price and time we have created an algorithm which estimates these parameters based on historical data.

To find the shortest path, we have implemented a path finding algorithm based on A-star. Although not perfect yet, considering we had less than 24 hours to create the solution, we believe we have all in all created a great solution for making the world a better place.
